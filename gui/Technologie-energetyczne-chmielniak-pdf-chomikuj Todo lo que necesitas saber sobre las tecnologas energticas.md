Energy technologies are the methods and processes of converting various sources of energy into useful forms of energy, such as electricity, heat, or mechanical work. Energy technologies can be classified into renewable and non-renewable, depending on whether they use resources that can be replenished or not. Some examples of renewable energy technologies are solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. Some examples of non-renewable energy technologies are coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and fossil fuels.

One of the challenges of energy technologies is to find the optimal balance between efficiency, cost, environmental impact, and social acceptability. Energy technologies also need to adapt to the changing needs and demands of society, as well as to the availability and quality of energy resources. Therefore, energy technologies require constant research and development to improve their performance and reliability.
 
A comprehensive and up-to-date source of information on energy technologies is the handbook "Technologie Energetyczne" (Energy Technologies) by Tadeusz Chmielniak[^1^], a professor at the Institute of Turbomachinery at the Silesian University of Technology in Poland. The handbook covers the basic principles, characteristics, applications, and challenges of various energy technologies, both commercially available and under development. The handbook also provides an overview of the main research targets and directions in the field of energy technologies.
 
The handbook "Technologie Energetyczne" is available in PDF format on Chomikuj.pl[^2^], a popular Polish file-sharing website. Chomikuj.pl allows users to upload and download files for free or for a fee, depending on the size and type of the file.

Energy technologies are essential for the development and well-being of humanity. They enable us to produce and use energy for various purposes, such as lighting, heating, cooling, transportation, communication, industry, and more. Energy technologies also have a significant impact on the environment and society, as they affect the emission of greenhouse gases, the consumption of natural resources, the generation of waste, and the creation of jobs and wealth.
 
Therefore, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of different energy technologies, as well as their potential and limitations. It is also important to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of energy technologies in different contexts and scenarios. For example, some energy technologies may be more suitable for certain regions or countries than others, depending on the availability and quality of energy resources, the climate and geography, the infrastructure and regulations, and the social and economic factors.
 
The handbook "Technologie Energetyczne" by Tadeusz Chmielniak provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of various energy technologies, both renewable and non-renewable. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities of energy technologies in the context of global energy demand and supply, climate change, energy security, and energy transition. The handbook is intended for students, researchers, engineers, policymakers, and anyone interested in energy technologies and their implications for the future.
