MATLAB is a popular software for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It is used by engineers, scientists, and students for various applications such as signal processing, image processing, control systems, and machine learning. MATLAB runs on different operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. However, not all versions of MATLAB are compatible with all versions of Windows. In this article, we will show you how to download MATLAB 2013a for Windows 7 64-bit.
 
## Why MATLAB 2013a?
 
MATLAB 2013a is the release of MATLAB that was launched in March 2013. It introduced many new features and enhancements, such as:

- A new MATLAB Desktop with a redesigned user interface and improved performance.
- A new MuPAD Notebook app that allows you to write symbolic expressions and functions in MuPAD language.
- A new Symbolic Math Toolbox that provides a notepad interface for solving mathematical problems and exporting them to HTML or PDF.
- A new Data Acquisition Toolbox that supports a broad range of data acquisition devices from different vendors.
- A new Vehicle Network Toolbox that supports CAN hardware from multiple vendors.
- Improved support for 64-bit Excel in MATLAB Compiler.
- Improved support for 64-bit VXI plug&play, IVI-C, and MATLAB instrument drivers in Instrument Control Toolbox.
- And many more. You can find the complete list of new features and changes in the [release notes](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/release-notes.html).

MATLAB 2013a is also one of the last releases of MATLAB that supports Windows 7 64-bit. The latest release of MATLAB, R2021b, only supports Windows 10. Therefore, if you have a Windows 7 64-bit system and you need to use MATLAB for compatibility purposes, you may want to download MATLAB 2013a.
 
## How to Download MATLAB 2013a?
 
To download MATLAB 2013a for Windows 7 64-bit, you need to have a valid license and an account on the MathWorks website. If you do not have a license or an account, you can either purchase one from the [MathWorks Store](https://www.mathworks.com/store/), or request a free trial from the [MathWorks Trial](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html) page. You can also check if you are eligible for a [student](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/students.html) or [faculty](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/faculty_center.html) license.

Once you have a license and an account, follow these steps to download MATLAB 2013a:

1. Go to the [MathWorks Downloads](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/) page and sign in with your MathWorks account.
2. Select MATLAB from the list of products and choose R2013a from the list of releases.
3. Select Windows (64-bit) from the list of platforms and click on Download.
4. You will be prompted to save a file named Matlab\_R2013a\_Full\_Setup.iso. This is an ISO image file that contains the installation files for MATLAB 2013a. Save it to a location on your computer where you have enough space (about 6 GB).
5. After the download is complete, you need to mount the ISO image file as a virtual drive. You can use a third-party software such as [PowerISO](https://www.poweriso.com/) or [WinISO](https://www.winiso.com/) for this purpose. Alternatively, you can use the built-in Windows Disc Image Burner tool by right-clicking on the ISO file and choosing Burn disc image.
6. Once the ISO image file is mounted or burned, open it and run setup.exe to start the installation process. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You will need to enter your license number and activate your product during the installation.
