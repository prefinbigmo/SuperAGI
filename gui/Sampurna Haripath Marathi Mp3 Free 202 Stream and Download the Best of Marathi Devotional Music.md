Sampoorna Haripath is based on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads and the Vedas. The poems express the essence of the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, which states that there is only one reality, which is Brahman or God, and that everything else is an illusion or Maya. The poems also emphasize the importance of Bhakti or devotion as the easiest and most effective way to realize one's true nature as Brahman. By chanting the name of Hari, which is one of the names of God, one can overcome the bondage of Maya and attain liberation or Moksha.
 
The album consists of seven songs, each corresponding to a different stage of spiritual progress. The first song is Dnyaneshwar Mauli Haripath, which is an invocation to JÃ±aneshwar, the author of the first song and one of the greatest saints of Maharashtra.
