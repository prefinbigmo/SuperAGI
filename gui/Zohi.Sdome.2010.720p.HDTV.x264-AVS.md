The movie is a comical depiction of the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities that were destroyed by God for their wickedness. The movie focuses on the families of Lot, the only righteous man in Sodom, and Bera, the king of Sodom. Lot (played by Dov Navon) is a lottery stall owner who dreams of building a cultural center for the children of Sodom. His wife (played by Tal Friedman) is a former pop singer whose career went downhill after she married Lot. They have a single daughter, Charlotte (played by Alma Zak).
 
Bera (played by Eli Finish) is a corrupt dictator who rules Sodom with an iron fist. He has two sons: the elder and successful Nineveh (played by Assi Cohen), and the younger and stupid Liam (played by Mariano Idelman). When Bera accidentally finds out that Sodom is about to be destroyed and Lot saved, he concocts a plan to switch places with Lot, as the archangels sent to destroy the city had never actually seen Lot. He sends his elder son to seduce Charlotte, but to his chagrin his son falls in love.
 
The movie is full of hilarious scenes and jokes that poke fun at the Biblical story, as well as modern Israeli culture and politics. The movie also features cameo appearances by famous Israeli celebrities, such as Eyal Kitzis as God, Moti Kirschenbaum as Abraham, and Yehuda Levi as Isaac.

**Zohi Sdom** is a movie that will make you laugh out loud and enjoy a fresh and original take on an ancient story. Don't miss this opportunity to watch one of the most successful Israeli comedies ever made!
  
One of the highlights of **Zohi Sdom** is the performance of Eli Finish as Bera, the king of Sodom. Finish is one of the most popular and versatile comedians in Israel, and he delivers a hilarious portrayal of a tyrannical and clueless leader who tries to save himself and his family from the impending doom. Finish also co-wrote the script of the movie with Muli Segev, Asaf Shalmon, and David Lipschitz.
 
Another standout in the movie is Assi Cohen as Nineveh, Bera's elder son. Cohen is best known for his role as Amjad in the hit TV series *Arab Labor*, where he plays an Arab journalist who struggles to fit in with Israeli society. In **Zohi Sdom**, Cohen shows his comedic range as a spoiled and arrogant prince who falls in love with Lot's daughter and rebels against his father.
 
The movie also features a catchy and funny soundtrack composed by Ran Shem Tov, who is a singer, songwriter, and producer. The soundtrack includes songs that parody various genres and styles, such as pop, rock, rap, and folk. Some of the songs are sung by the actors themselves, such as Tal Friedman's "I'm a Star" and Eli Finish's "I'm the King". The soundtrack also includes a cover version of "The Sound of Silence" by Simon & Garfunkel, sung by Eyal Kitzis as God.
