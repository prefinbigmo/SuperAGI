For example, Richard Trenholm of CNET wrote that "Pirates of Silicon Valley is shot with real verve" and that "Hall's is the more interesting performance" as Gates[^1^]. Jason Snell of Macworld wrote that "Pirates of Silicon Valley is a fascinating film that tells the true story of how Bill Gates and Steve Jobs changed the world with their vision and innovation" and that "Wyle is uncannily similar to the young Apple co-founder"[^2^]. Ray Richmond of Variety wrote that "writer-director Martyn Burke has taken the battle fought in the microchip trenches at the dawn of the computer revolution and turned it into a wildly entertaining geek tragedy with the stylistic feel of true art"[^4^].

O'Connor of The New York Times wrote that "as a movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley falters because it doesn't have much connective tissue" and that "the film seems to have been made by people who don't really understand computers or their history". David Bianculli of New York Daily News wrote that "the film is too slanted toward Apple and against Microsoft" and that "it's hard to care about any of these characters, who are either too smug or too whiny".
